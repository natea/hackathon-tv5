## Key Teaching Moments (1-2 min each)

### Scenario 1: "I Feel" vs. "You Always"
**What Works**: "I feel invisible when you help him but not me"  
**What Doesn't**: "You always favor him"  
**Why**: Can't argue with internal experience; easier to defend against accusations

### Scenario 2: Broken Record
**What Works**: Repeat boundary without new material  
**What Doesn't**: Justify, argue, defend, explain (JADE)  
**Why**: Each explanation gives ammunition for continued debate

### Scenario 3: Gray-Rocking
**What Works**: "Okay, I hear you." (End)  
**What Doesn't**: "But X happened! You said Y!"  
**Why**: Removes fuel for debate; boring responses end interrogation

### Scenario 4: Need vs. Neediness
**Healthy Need**: Want basic connection with parent; knowing you're worthy  
**Unhealthy Neediness**: Can't function without frequent contact; guilt-trip  
**Your Situation**: You're in healthy category; his limitation ≠ your flaw

### Scenario 5: Systems Thinking
**The Role**: Family needs scapegoat for dysfunction  
**The Truth**: Scapegoating serves psychological purpose for family  
**The Choice**: Keep role (enmeshed) or reject it (face family anger)  
**The Work**: Grief + agency, not fixing them

---

## Audience Engagement Prompts

**After each scenario, ask:**

**Scenario 1**: "What would YOU say to your mom in this moment? [Wait 10 sec] Who wants to try?"

**Scenario 2**: "See how that didn't work? What if she tries to justify reading your phone? How do you stay firm?"

**Scenario 3**: "The urge to prove it happened is SO strong. Show of hands—who feels that way when family denies conflict?"

**Scenario 4**: "Here's the hard part. He probably WON'T change. How does that land? Who's grieving something similar?"

**Scenario 5**: "Sometimes the conversation isn't 'fix this.' It's 'accept this is broken and I didn't break it.' That's the real work."

## Backup Plans

| If This Fails | Do This |
|---------------|---------|
| API latency > 3 sec | Play pre-recorded conversation; explain: "Let me show you this from earlier" |
| Response feels robotic | Facilitator takes over as family member; easier to keep real |
| Audience disengaged | Move faster through scenarios; get to controversial ones sooner |
| Conversation runs long | Cut to reflection after 3 exchanges, not 5 |
| Technical crash | Have 1-2 pre-recorded full demos ready to play; smooth transition |

## Opening Statement (Read This)

```
"Most people avoid difficult family conversations because they:
- Don't know how to start
- Fear escalation or rejection  
- Can't predict what will happen
- Feel guilty for having needs
- Are trapped in old patterns

Today, we're going to practice 5 deeply difficult conversations.
You'll see emotional analysis happening in real-time.
You'll see what works, what escalates, and why.

The goal isn't to 'win' the conversation.
The goal is to communicate authentically AND protect yourself.

Let's begin."
```

---

## Closing Statement (Read This)

```
"Key takeaways:

1. EMOTIONS ARE DATA
   Your hurt/anger/guilt = information about your needs

2. PATTERNS REPEAT UNTIL SEEN
   The system helps identify cycles you're stuck in

3. YOU CAN'T CONTROL THEM; YOU CAN CONTROL YOU
   The goal is your clarity and authenticity, not their approval

4. BOUNDARIES ARE SELF-RESPECT IN ACTION
   Firmness + clarity + compassion = boundaries that work

5. WHEN FAMILY SYSTEMS CAN'T CHANGE
   You grieve what you didn't get. You choose what comes next.

This system gives you practice space BEFORE stakes get real.
You're not alone in these dynamics.
These conversations matter.

Let's take a break. Then open Q&A."
```

## Handout: Take-Home Resource

```
FAMILY CONVERSATION TOOLKIT

Before a difficult conversation:
☐ Get clear on YOUR emotion first
☐ Identify what you actually need
☐ Practice with the system (roleplay mode)
☐ Set a time boundary
☐ Plan your exit strategy if escalates

During the conversation:
☐ Speak from "I" not "you"
☐ No justifying/arguing/defending/explaining
☐ Repeat boundary calmly if needed
☐ Acknowledge their perspective even if you disagree
☐ Leave room for you both to think

After:
☐ Reflect on what worked
☐ Grieve what didn't work (and might never)
☐ Decide what contact looks like going forward

• conversational-reflection.github.com (open source)
• "Set Boundaries, Find Peace" by Nedra Tawwab

## Success Metrics

**Track these:**
- How many people attended?
- How many participated/asked questions?
- Which scenario got most reaction?
- "I see myself in one of these" - count responses
- Will share with friend/family - count
- Downloaded the repo - track link clicks

**Aim for:**
- 60%+ engagement (questions or raised hands)
- At least 2 scenarios with visible emotional recognition
- 40%+ saying they'll try something different
